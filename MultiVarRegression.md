####Linear Regression with multiple variables

for problems with more than one input variables, we have modify the model to be:
```
y = A + Bx1 + Cx2 + Dx3 + ...
```
Then we have a coefficient matrix __C__.

To estimate the coeffiecients, we can use either *Gradient descent* or solve it directly by *Normal equation*.
