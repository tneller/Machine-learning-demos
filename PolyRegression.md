####hierarchical 

* Agglomerative (bottom-up): Start with all points in their own group. Until there is only one cluster, repeatedly: merge the two groups that have the smallest dissimilarity

* Divisive (top-down):
I Start with all points in one cluster
I Until all points are in their own cluster, repeatedly: split the
group into two resulting in the biggest dissimilarity
