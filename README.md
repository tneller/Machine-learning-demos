### Independent study on Data Mining

####Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is to find hidden structure in unlabeled data.

1. [Information retrieval and PageRank](IR&PageRank.md)

2. Clustering 
	* [K-means clustering](K-means.md)
	* [DBSCAN clustering](DBSCAN.md)
	* [Hierarchical clustering](Hierarchical.md)

####Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning is to make predictions based on given training set(inputs and outputs)

1. Regression
	* [Simple linear regression](SimpleLinear.md)
	* [Multivariate Linear regression with regularization](MultiVarRegression.md)

2. Classification
	* Naive Bayes classifier
	* K Nearest Neighbors classifier
	* Logistic classifier
	* Tree based classifiers
	* Support vector machine
